So even in this scenario, if the aim is to get to near-zero cases in an area, it will be necessary to supplement the app with other community-level preventative measures.<br>--------------------<br>It&#39;s an interesting problem for sure. Basically, the efficacy of these apps is dependent on the infection rate and acceptance of the technology, and there&#39;s no easy answer for either of those things. As far as I can tell, the best way to make contact tracing apps effective is to make them as simple and unobtrusive as possible, so that people actually use them when needed.<br>--------------------<br>However, given the current situation that&#39;s not feasible and contact tracing apps are more of a stopgap measure until the vaccine is ready.<br><br>Hi! That&#39;s a great breakdown of how contact tracing apps can work and why their effectiveness is limited to some degree. I think it&#39;s worth noting though that any measure we can take to break the chain of transmission can be a helpful part of the solution.<br>--------------------<br>Yeah, that&#39;s a good point. You would need to have an extremely high adoption rate for it to be effective, but even so, the number of interactions detected would still be limited, especially due to false positives. It would definitely be most useful in areas with just a few active cases, where isolating people and containing the virus is easier.<br>--------------------<br>That&#39;s why I was saying it could have been useful 2-3 months ago in several states, but since it has been widely adopted I don&#39;t think it will do much of anything because of the amount of false positives (and lack of trust people will have in the results)</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1979784579R5" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">6</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Respond to chat as Kyle:<br><br>Recent messages:<br><br>Kyle:<br>[Photo]<br>Preparing the terrace<br><br>Karen:<br>Oh, perfect!
